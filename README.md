#USAGE
=========
You can either create a bookmark on your browser and insert the script
in the url path, or you can use this page www.cidadecool.com/z-tunes/YIMLE/
and bookmark the link.
After having the bookmarklet, whenever you are on a youtube video page
you can click the bookmark, it will redirect to mobile version of the site
and by clicking again the download should start.

warning: some browsers like chromium have a built in html5 video player
which will be triggered and because of this some of you might need an extra
step of right clicking and selecting save.
